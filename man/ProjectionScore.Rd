\title{Compute projection score with bootstrapping}
\usage{
ProjectionScore(DataMatrix, NPCs = 3, nboot = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{DataMatrix}{Matrix. Numeric data matrix (samples x features) to compute the projection score on.}

\item{NPCs}{Integer. Number of principal components to use. Default is 3.}

\item{nboot}{Integer. Number of bootstrap iterations. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Fraction of variance for projection score bootstrapped average.
}
\description{
Calculates the projection score as the difference between the explained variance (AlphaPE) and its bootstrapped average (BootAlpha) for a given data matrix. Useful for evaluating the stability of principal component projections.
}
\examples{
# Example with random data
set.seed(123)
mat <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)
ProjectionScore(mat, NPCs = 3, nboot = 50)
}
