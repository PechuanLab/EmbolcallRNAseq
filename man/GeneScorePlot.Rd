\title{Plot gene signature scores by group with statistical comparisons}
\usage{
GeneScorePlot(Signature, Pheno, my_comparisons, Factor, Palette)
}
\arguments{
\item{Signature}{Numeric vector. Gene signature scores for each sample (length must match number of rows in \code{Pheno}).}

\item{Pheno}{Data frame. Phenotype/sample metadata, one row per sample.}

\item{my_comparisons}{List of character vectors. Each vector specifies two group names (as in \code{Factor}) to compare.}

\item{Factor}{Character. Column name in \code{Pheno} to use for grouping and coloring.}

\item{Palette}{Character vector. Colors to use for each group in the plot.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (boxplot with jitter and statistical comparisons).
}
\description{
This function creates a boxplot (with jitter) of gene signature scores (e.g., PC scores) grouped by a specified phenotype variable, and adds statistical comparisons between specified groups.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  GeneScorePlot(
    Signature = pcSig,
    Pheno = yf$samples,
    my_comparisons = list(c("TumorDay1", "SkinDay8")),
    Factor = "Treatment",
    Palette = c("red", "blue")
