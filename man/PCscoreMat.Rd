\title{Compute a principal component score matrix for clusters}
\usage{
PCscoreMat(ExprMat, pure_markers)
}
\arguments{
\item{ExprMat}{A numeric matrix of gene expression values with genes as rows and samples as columns.}

\item{pure_markers}{A data frame with columns `gene` and `cluster`, specifying marker genes for each cluster.}
}
\value{
A matrix of scaled scores with clusters as rows and samples as columns.
        Clusters with no matching genes in the expression matrix are excluded.
}
\description{
This function calculates a score matrix for each cluster based on expression of marker genes.
For each cluster, it extracts the relevant genes from the expression matrix and computes a score
using the `gsScoreLegacy()` function. The scores are scaled and returned as a matrix.
