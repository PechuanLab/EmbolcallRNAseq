\title{Compute sample scores from a gene expression matrix using legacy summarization}
\usage{
gsScoreLegacy(gm, summarizationFunction = "PC")
}
\arguments{
\item{gm}{A numeric matrix of gene expression values with genes as rows and samples as columns.
This matrix should contain only the genes of interest.}

\item{summarizationFunction}{A string specifying the summarization method: `"PC"` (default) for principal component analysis,
or `"mean"` for average expression.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of scores for each sample.
}
\description{
This function calculates a score for each sample based on the expression of a set of genes.
If multiple genes are provided, the score is computed using either the first principal component (PC)
or the mean expression across genes. If only one gene is provided, its expression values are returned directly.
}
\examples{
# Using principal component summarization
gsScoreLegacy(gm = expression_matrix_subset, summarizationFunction = "PC")

# Using mean summarization
gsScoreLegacy(gm = expression_matrix_subset, summarizationFunction = "mean")
}
