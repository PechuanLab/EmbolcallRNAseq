\title{Plot STAMP deconvolution signature scores by compartment}
\usage{
STAMPDeconvolPlot(ExprMat, Pheno, my_comparisons, Factor, Palette, Compartment)
}
\arguments{
\item{ExprMat}{Matrix. Expression matrix (genes x samples) for deconvolution.}

\item{Pheno}{Data frame. Phenotype/sample metadata to merge with scores.}

\item{my_comparisons}{List. List of group comparisons for plotting (not directly used in function, but included for compatibility).}

\item{Factor}{Character. Column name in `Pheno` to use for coloring groups.}

\item{Palette}{Character vector. Colors to use for group levels in the plot.}

\item{Compartment}{Character. Compartment to subset cell types for plotting (e.g., "Lymphoid", "Stroma", "Myeloid", "Other").}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object: boxplot of STAMP atlas signature scores by cell type and group.
}
\description{
Generates a boxplot of STAMP atlas signature scores for different cell types within a specified compartment, using principal component scores and phenotype information. Useful for visualizing deconvolution results across experimental groups.

\examples{
# Example usage (requires proper input objects):
# STAMPDeconvolPlot(ExprMat, Pheno, my_comparisons, Factor = "Group", Palette = c("red", "blue"), Compartment = "Lymphoid")
