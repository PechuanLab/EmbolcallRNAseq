\title{Generate GSEA Plots and Save Results}
\usage{
ClusterProfilerPlots(ewp2, Prefix, contraste, DataBase, geneList)
}
\arguments{
\item{ewp2}{An object containing GSEA results, typically generated by the `clusterProfiler::GSEA` function.}

\item{Prefix}{A string used as a prefix for output file names and plot titles.}

\item{contraste}{A string specifying the contrast or condition being analyzed. This is used in output file names and plot titles.}

\item{DataBase}{A string specifying the database used for GSEA (e.g., "WikiPathways", "MSigDB").}

\item{geneList}{A named numeric vector representing the gene list used for GSEA. The names should correspond to gene identifiers, and the values should represent the ranking metric (e.g., log fold change or statistical significance).}
}
\value{
This function generates and saves plots as PDF files and writes GSEA results to CSV files. It does not return any R objects directly.
}
\description{
This function generates various plots based on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results, including bar plots, enrichment plots, network plots, and heatmaps. It also saves the GSEA results and writes them to CSV files for further analysis.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# Assuming `ewp2` is a GSEA result object, `Prefix` is "Experiment1",
# `contraste` is "ConditionA", `DataBase` is "WikiPathways", and `geneList` is a named numeric vector:
ClusterProfilerPlots(ewp2, "Experiment1", "ConditionA", "WikiPathways", geneList)
