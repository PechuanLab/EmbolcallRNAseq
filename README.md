The goal of this package is to provide a set of plotting functions that can aid the analysis and interpretation of bulk RNA sequencing data. We rely heavily on exploratory analyses prior to hypothesis testing. By providing a biological pathway annotation on the most informative gene clusters of the datasets we aid the biological interpreation of the results. Alternatively, we provide a simple microenvironment deconvolution for mouse tumor data based on a published reference scRNAseq atlas.
